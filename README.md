I'm Simon (he/him), an R developer and statistics student. I'm currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Johns Hopkins working on a PhD in Biostatistics.

#### 🐛 Software

I work on software for statistical modeling (formerly at [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio)) and co-author and -maintain some R packages such as:  

- [tidymodels/broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom): convert statistical analysis objects to tidy tibbles
- [tidymodels/infer](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer): a grammar for tidy statistical inference
- [tidymodels/stacks](https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks): tidymodels-friendly model stacking and ensembling
- [simonpcouch/anyflights](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights): query `nycflights13`-like data for any recent year and US airport
- [simonpcouch/gbfs](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gbfs): query data on public bikes from hundreds of bikeshare programs
- [rudeboybert/forestecology](https://github.com/rudeboybert/forestecology): methods for model fitting and assessment in forest ecology

#### 🦆 Research

My research is in privacy-preserving data analysis. Source code for some of my papers can be found here:  

- [simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht](https://github.com/simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht): _Differentially Private Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing_
- [simonpcouch/wilcoxon](https://github.com/simonpcouch/wilcoxon): _A Differentially Private Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test_

I also really value social-technical research, and have written a bit about R, differential privacy, and social inequality:  

- [simonpcouch/social_divisions_in_data](https://github.com/simonpcouch/social_divisions_in_data): _Characterizing How Social Difference is Encoded in CRAN Data_
- [simonpcouch/dp_census](https://github.com/simonpcouch/dp_census): _Differential Privacy, Race, and the 2020 U.S. Census_
- [simonpcouch/gendering_documentation](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gendering_documentation): _Gender, Documentation, and Communities of Statistical Computing_

#### 🐥 Say hi!

If you're interested in trainings/workshops about R, the tidyverse, or tidymodels, please get in touch! I'm an [rstudio-certified](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/couch+simon/) tidyverse trainer.

Please feel to reach out [by email](mailto:simonpatrickcouch@gmail.com) or by twitter [@simonpcouch](https://twitter.com/simonpcouch)! I've written a bit more about what I work on on my [website](https://simonpcouch.com) and my [blog](https://blog.simonpcouch.com/).

If you'd like to support my blog and/or maintenance on {broom}, {infer}, and {stacks}, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/simonpcouch).
