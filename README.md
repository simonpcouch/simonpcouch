I'm Simon (he/him), an R developer and data scientist. I work on statistical software at [Posit PBC](https://github.com/posit-pbc) (formerly RStudio).üêõ

Most of the time, I'm a generalist maintainer on R packages for statistical modeling:

- [tidymodels/broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom): convert statistical analysis objects to tidy tibbles
- [tidymodels/infer](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer): a grammar for tidy statistical inference
- [tidymodels/stacks](https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks): tidymodels-friendly model stacking and ensembling
- [tidymodels/bonsai](https://github.com/tidymodels/bonsai): model wrappers for tree-based models
- [tidymodels/workflows](https://github.com/tidymodels/workflows): combine preprocessing, modeling, and postprocessing objects
- [tidymodels/tailor](https://github.com/tidymodels/tailor): postprocessing with tidymodels
- [tidymodels/workflowsets](https://github.com/tidymodels/workflowsets): creating collections of modeling workflows
- [rstudio/bundle](https://github.com/simonpcouch/bundle): a consistent interface for model serialization

The other part of my gig is maintaining database interfaces for R:

- [r-dbi/odbc](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc): connect to any ODBC-compliant database with DBI
- [tidyverse/dbplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr): database backend for dplyr

I also maintain some personal R packages that range in functionality from LLM-assisted coding to performance profiling to data querying to biological methods:

- [simonpcouch/pal](https://github.com/simonpcouch/pal): LLM assistants for R
- [simonpcouch/syrup](https://github.com/simonpcouch/syrup): profile memory and CPU usage of parallel R code
- [simonpcouch/stopwatch](https://github.com/simonpcouch/stopwatch): high precision timings using mocking
- [simonpcouch/anyflights](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights): query `nycflights13`-like data for any recent year and US airport
- [simonpcouch/gbfs](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gbfs): query data on public bikes from hundreds of bikeshare programs
- [simonpcouch/carpentR](https://github.com/simonpcouch/carpentR): predicting lake algal blooms using plankton dynamics
- [rudeboybert/forestecology](https://github.com/rudeboybert/forestecology): methods for model fitting and assessment in forest ecology
- [simonpcouch/detectors](https://github.com/simonpcouch/detectors): prediction data from GPT detectors
- [simonpcouch/readmission](https://github.com/simonpcouch/readmission): hospital readmission data for patients with type 1 diabetes
- [simonpcouch/forested](https://github.com/simonpcouch/forested): forest attributes in Washington State
