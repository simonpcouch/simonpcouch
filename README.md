I'm Simon (he/him), an R developer and data scientist. I work on software for statistical modeling at [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio) as a generalist maintainer on the tidymodels package ecosystem.üêõ

Here are some R packages for statistical modeling that I work on:  

- [tidymodels/broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom): convert statistical analysis objects to tidy tibbles
- [tidymodels/infer](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer): a grammar for tidy statistical inference
- [tidymodels/stacks](https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks): tidymodels-friendly model stacking and ensembling
- [tidymodels/bonsai](https://github.com/tidymodels/bonsai): model wrappers for tree-based models
- [tidymodels/workflows](https://github.com/tidymodels/workflows): combine pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing objects
- [tidymodels/workflowsets](https://github.com/tidymodels/workflowsets): creating collections of modeling workflows
- [rstudio/bundle](https://github.com/simonpcouch/bundle): a consistent interface for model serialization

I also maintain a few personal R packages that range in functionality from data querying to biological methods:

- [simonpcouch/anyflights](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights): query `nycflights13`-like data for any recent year and US airport
- [simonpcouch/gbfs](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gbfs): query data on public bikes from hundreds of bikeshare programs
- [simonpcouch/carpentR](https://github.com/simonpcouch/carpentR): predicting lake algal blooms using plankton dynamics
- [rudeboybert/forestecology](https://github.com/rudeboybert/forestecology): methods for model fitting and assessment in forest ecology
