i'm simon (he/him), an R developer and statistics student, currently working on my undergrad in math/statistics at reed college.

#### üêõ software

i work on software for statistical modeling (formerly at [rstudio](https://github.com/rstudio)), and have co-authored some R packages such as:  

- [tidymodels/broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom): convert statistical analysis objects to tidy tibbles
- [tidymodels/infer](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer): a grammar for tidy statistical inference
- [tidymodels/stacks](https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks): tidymodels-friendly model stacking and ensembling
- [simonpcouch/anyflights](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights): query `nycflights13`-like data for any recent year and US airport
- [simonpcouch/gbfs](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gbfs): query data on public bikes from hundreds of bikeshare programs

#### ü¶Ü research

my research is in privacy-preserving data analysis. source code for some of my papers can be found here:  

- [simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht](https://github.com/simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht): _Differentially Private Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing_
- [simonpcouch/wilcoxon](https://github.com/simonpcouch/wilcoxon): _A Differentially Private Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test_

i also really value social-technical research, and have written a bit about R, differential privacy, and social inequality:  

- [simonpcouch/social_divisions_in_data](https://github.com/simonpcouch/social_divisions_in_data): _Characterizing How Social Difference is Encoded in CRAN Data_
- [simonpcouch/dp_census](https://github.com/simonpcouch/dp_census): _Differential Privacy, Race, and the 2020 U.S. Census_
- [simonpcouch/gendering_documentation](https://github.com/simonpcouch/gendering_documentation): _Gender, Documentation, and Communities of Statistical Computing_
